# Playbook: Payments & PCI

**Audience:** Claude Code and the operator.
**Read before:** touching anything in `payments.md`, webhooks, or any UI that collects card details.

## PCI scope: SAQ-A only

We use **Stripe Connect Standard**. The venue is their own Stripe account (merchant of record). Card details are entered into Stripe's hosted Elements / Payment Element. Our frontend and backend **never see raw card data**.

This keeps us in PCI **SAQ-A** scope: the smallest possible compliance footprint (~20 questions, self-assessed annually). Any design change that would expand scope is forbidden without re-reading this playbook and explicit approval.

## What is never allowed

- No raw PANs, CVVs, expiry dates, cardholder names from card, magnetic stripe or track data on our servers, logs, or databases. **Ever.**
- No proxying card data through our API routes. Use Stripe.js / Payment Element client-side tokenisation only.
- No screenshots or HAR captures containing card fields included in bug reports or Sentry events.
- No storing Stripe publishable keys in source (public is fine to bundle; secret goes in env only).
- No customer card tokens in our database except Stripe's `payment_method_id` reference — never the raw details.

## What we do store

- `stripe_accounts`: the Connected Account ID (`acct_...`) per organisation.
- `payments`: Stripe PaymentIntent ID (`pi_...`), status, amounts.
- `stripe_events`: raw event envelopes from Stripe (for idempotency; no card data is present in these events).

All amounts are in minor units (pence). Never floats.

## Payment flows (see `payments.md` spec for full detail)

1. **Deposit required** — `PaymentIntent` with `capture_method: automatic`, charged at booking time.
2. **Card hold / no-show fee** — `SetupIntent` at booking, stored `payment_method_id`, charged via `PaymentIntent` with `off_session: true` only if no-show rule fires.
3. **No deposit** — no Stripe involvement at all.

3D Secure is forced (`request_three_d_secure: 'any'`). We do not disable SCA even for low-value amounts, even for returning customers.

## Webhooks

- Endpoint: `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`.
- Verify signature using `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Reject with 400 on any verification failure.
- **Idempotency:** every event written to `stripe_events(id pk, type, received_at, handled_at, payload)`. Handler is a no-op if `id` already exists.
- Handle: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, `charge.refunded`, `account.updated`.
- Retries: Stripe retries up to 3 days. Our handler must be idempotent and fast (<5s).

### Connect events — important

Deposit PaymentIntents live on the **connected account**, not the platform. Events on connected accounts are a separate delivery stream:

- **Local dev:** `stripe listen --forward-connect-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook` — both flags together, otherwise you'll only see platform events.
- **Staging / prod:** configure **two** webhook endpoints in the Stripe dashboard pointing at the same URL. One is type "Account" (platform events: `account.updated`, etc.), the other is type "Connect" (connected-account events: `payment_intent.*`, `charge.*`). Both have their own `whsec_*`; use the same value for `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` by creating them with the same signing secret, or keep them separate and extend the receiver to try both.
- Smoke check: trigger a deposit → `stripe listen` should log `payment_intent.succeeded` with `account=acct_*` set.

## Idempotency keys

Every Stripe create-call uses a deterministic idempotency key so network retries + webhook races converge safely:

- `customer_<guest_id>_v1` — `stripe.customers.create` on first deposit for a guest.
- `booking_<booking_id>_deposit_v1` — `stripe.paymentIntents.create` for the deposit flow.
- `refund_<payments_row_id>_v1` — `stripe.refunds.create` for operator-initiated refunds.

The `_v1` suffix lets us rotate keys if a bug ever forces a different body for the same logical operation.

## Stripe Intent / booking transaction boundary

**Rule:** the Stripe API call never runs inside the booking DB transaction. See `lib/bookings/create.ts`. The ordering is:

1. Inside the transaction: insert booking at `status='requested'` + a placeholder `payments` row with `stripe_intent_id='pending_<bookingId>'`, `status='pending_creation'`.
2. Outside the transaction: `stripe.paymentIntents.create(...)` with the idempotency key from above.
3. Still outside: update the placeholder row with the real `pi_*` + Stripe status.

If step 2 or 3 fails, the booking + placeholder remain in `requested`/`pending_creation`. The janitor (`lib/payments/janitor.ts`) sweeps them after 15 minutes — cancels the Intent if a real `pi_*` exists, transitions the booking to `cancelled` with `cancelled_reason='deposit_abandoned'`, marks the payments row `canceled`. Two callers run it:

1. **Daily Vercel Cron** at 03:00 UTC (`vercel.json` → `/api/cron/deposit-janitor`). Vercel Hobby caps cron frequency at once-per-day; this is the overnight backstop. Move to `*/5 * * * *` (or similar) after the Pro upgrade. The same route also runs `sweepDueNoShowCaptures()` (flow B) — Hobby allows only one cron schedule, so the route is the single nightly maintenance entry point.
2. **Inline sweep on `POST /api/v1/bookings`** scoped to the booking's venue. Active venues clean up in near-real-time as a side-effect of the next booker arriving. Fire-and-forget semantics: if the sweep throws we log + continue so the booking isn't blocked.

## Flow B — card hold + off-session no-show capture

Flow B uses a `SetupIntent` (not a PaymentIntent) at booking time so no money moves up front. Same Customer-on-the-connected-account pattern as flow A; the eventual capture amount rides in `metadata.hold_amount_minor` so the no-show sweeper doesn't re-resolve the rule.

The `setup_intent.succeeded` handler stores the resulting `customer` + `payment_method` ids on the `payments` row (kind='hold') so the off-session capture can charge them later.

### No-show capture

`lib/payments/no-show.ts#sweepDueNoShowCaptures` finds bookings where:

- `status = 'confirmed'` (no `seated` / `finished` transition happened)
- a `payments` row with `kind='hold'`, `status='succeeded'` exists (card stored)
- `start_at + 30 minutes < now()`
- no prior `kind='no_show_capture'` row exists for this booking

For each candidate, it creates an off-session PaymentIntent on the connected account: `{ off_session: true, confirm: true, payment_method, customer }` with idempotency key `booking_<id>_no_show_capture_v1`. A new `payments` row records the capture (succeeded or failed) and the booking transitions to `no_show` either way — they didn't turn up regardless of whether the bank approved the off-session charge.

Two callers, same shape as the abandonment janitor:

1. **Daily cron** (the same `/api/cron/deposit-janitor` route — see above).
2. **Inline trigger on `/dashboard/venues/[venueId]/bookings`** page load, scoped to that venue. Operators viewing today's bookings during service drive near-real-time captures.

If the off-session capture fails (declined card, 3DS now required, expired card), the `payments` row's `status='failed'` plus `failure_code` / `failure_message` give operators the diagnostic, and `audit_log.action = 'stripe.no_show_capture.failed'` flags it. Operator chases manually — there's no automated retry to avoid hammering already-declined cards.

## Refunds

- Refunds triggered from dashboard only (not from automated flows).
- Full refund = cancel within the deposit window (from `deposit_rules.refund_window_hours`).
- Partial refund = manual operator action with reason captured. (Partial UI is a phase-2 follow-up; MVP ships full-refund only.)
- Refunds are logged in `audit_log` with `user_id` of the operator who initiated them. The actor id also rides in Stripe `metadata.actor_user_id` so the eventual `charge.refunded` webhook can verify attribution without request context.

## Replaying stuck events

`stripe_events` keeps every event we've ever received, with `handled_at` null iff no registered handler ran (either because the type isn't wired, or because dispatch threw). To replay:

1. `SELECT id, type, payload FROM stripe_events WHERE handled_at IS NULL ORDER BY received_at;`
2. For each row, fetch the payload and replay through `dispatch()` from `lib/stripe/webhook.ts` (a script under `scripts/` is the right home if this ever becomes routine).
3. `markHandled(eventId)` on success.

Alternatively, re-trigger from Stripe dashboard → Developers → Events → ⋯ → Resend.

## Refunds

- Refunds triggered from dashboard only (not from automated flows).
- Full refund = cancel within the deposit window (from `deposit_rules.refund_window_hours`).
- Partial refund = manual operator action with reason captured.
- Refunds are logged in `audit_log` with `user_id` of the operator who initiated them.

## Connect onboarding

- Use Stripe's Express or Standard hosted onboarding flow. Do not collect KYC data ourselves.
- Venues are blocked from taking payments until `charges_enabled: true` on the connected account.
- We don't platform fees on MVP — Stripe's standard rate passes through, we take our subscription fee separately.

## Testing

- Test mode uses Stripe's published test cards. Record them in `tests/payments/fixtures.ts`, don't invent new ones.
- E2E Playwright tests hit a dedicated test Stripe account, never the live account.
- Never use real cards in development. Use 4242 4242 4242 4242 etc.

## If you are unsure

If a feature request touches cards in any way that isn't on the list above, **stop and ask** before implementing. Expanding PCI scope beyond SAQ-A is a one-way door and directly undermines the whole commercial proposition.

## Annual tasks

- Renew SAQ-A self-assessment (calendar reminder).
- Review Stripe's compliance requirements for any changes.
- Confirm no logs or backups captured card data (spot check Sentry events, app logs).
- Rotate webhook secret if there's any suspicion of exposure.
